Welcome to the Access Control React-MUI-Redux Template! This template provides a solid foundation for building web applications with role-based permissions and authentication setup. It combines the power of React, Material-UI, and Redux to create a scalable and maintainable application.

## Features

- Role-based access control with different user roles and permissions.
- Authentication setup using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
- Clean and intuitive user interface using Material-UI components and styles.
- Redux for state management, providing a predictable and centralized store for your application data.
- Ready-to-use codebase for quick development start.
- Fully responsive design, ensuring your application looks great on various devices.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version >= 12.0.0)
- npm (version >= 6.0.0)
- Git (version >= 2.0.0)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affan-habib/access-control.git
cd access-control
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install

npm start
Your application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Authentication and Authorization
The template includes a built-in authentication setup using JWT. Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application. The role-based access control allows you to define different user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest) and set permissions accordingly. To customize authentication behavior, refer to the provided services and reducers.

Customization
Feel free to customize the template to fit your specific project needs. You can add new components, modify existing ones, or integrate additional libraries as required. The template provides a solid foundation, allowing you to focus on building features specific to your application.
Additional Features
The template includes the following additional features:

Dark and light mode support for a better user experience in different environments.
Font and theme color change options to personalize the application's appearance.
Deployment
When your application is ready for deployment, you can create a production build using the following command:

npm run build
This will create an optimized build in the build directory, ready for deployment to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.


We hope this template helps you kickstart your project with role-based permissions and authentication in React-MUI-Redux. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
